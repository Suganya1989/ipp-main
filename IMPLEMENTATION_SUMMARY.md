# Cloudflare R2 Image Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation enables automatic upload of og:images to Cloudflare R2 storage whenever a resource is opened. The system downloads the image from the original source, uploads it to your R2 bucket, and saves the R2 URL to the database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **R2 Upload Utility** (`lib/r2-util.ts`)

Created a comprehensive utility library for Cloudflare R2 operations:

- **`uploadImageToR2(imageUrl, resourceId)`**: Downloads an image from a URL and uploads it to R2
- **`uploadBufferToR2(buffer, filename, contentType)`**: Uploads a file buffer directly to R2
- Automatic file extension detection based on content type
- Unique filename generation with timestamps
- Error handling and logging

**Key Features:**
- Uses AWS S3 SDK (R2 is S3-compatible)
- Lazy initialization of R2 client
- Generates organized filenames: `resources/{resourceId}-{timestamp}.{ext}`

### 2. **Upload API Endpoint** (`app/api/upload-to-r2/route.ts`)

New POST endpoint that:
1. Accepts an image URL and resource ID
2. Calls `uploadImageToR2()` to upload to R2
3. Updates the database with the R2 URL using `updateResourceImage()`
4. Returns the public R2 URL

**Request:**
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/og-image.jpg",
  "resourceId": "abc-123-def-456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "r2Url": "https://pub-xxx.r2.dev/resources/abc-123-def-456-1234567890.jpg",
  "message": "Image uploaded to R2 and database updated successfully"
}
```

### 3. **Updated Resource Page** (`app/resource/[id]/page.tsx`)

Modified the `fetchAndSaveOgImage()` function to:
1. Extract og:image from the original source (existing functionality)
2. **NEW**: Upload the image to Cloudflare R2 via `/api/upload-to-r2`
3. **NEW**: Save the R2 URL (not the original URL) to the database
4. Update the UI to display the R2-hosted image

**Trigger:** Runs automatically whenever a resource page is loaded if the resource has a `linkToOriginalSource`

### 4. **Database Update Function** (`lib/weaviate-util.ts`)

Added `updateResourceImage(id, imageUrl)` function:
- Updates the `imageUrl` field in Weaviate's `DocsWithImages` collection
- Uses the Weaviate client's data updater API
- Returns success/failure status

### 5. **Dependencies** (`package.json`)

Installed:
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - AWS SDK for S3-compatible operations with Cloudflare R2

```

## How It Works

### Complete Flow

```
1. User opens resource page
   â†“
2. Frontend checks if resource has linkToOriginalSource
   â†“
3. Calls /api/extract-url to get og:image URL
   â†“
4. Calls /api/upload-to-r2 with:
   - imageUrl (from og:image)
   - resourceId
   â†“
5. Backend downloads image from URL
   â†“
6. Backend uploads to Cloudflare R2
   â†“
7. Backend updates Weaviate database with R2 URL
   â†“
8. Frontend receives R2 URL
   â†“
9. UI displays image from R2
```

### Technical Details

**Image Download:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(imageUrl)
const buffer = Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer())
```

**R2 Upload:**
```typescript
const command = new PutObjectCommand({
  Bucket: bucketName,
  Key: `resources/${resourceId}-${timestamp}.${extension}`,
  Body: buffer,
  ContentType: contentType,
})
await client.send(command)
```

**Database Update:**
```typescript
await client.data
  .updater()
  .withClassName('DocsWithImages')
  .withId(resourceId)
  .withProperties({ imageUrl: r2Url })
  .do()
```

## Required Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to `.env.local`:

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id_here
CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key_here
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name_here
CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-bucket-url.r2.dev
```

See `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on obtaining these values.

## Testing

1. **Set up Cloudflare R2:**
   - Create an R2 bucket
   - Generate API tokens
   - Configure public access
   - Add credentials to `.env.local`

2. **Restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the flow:**
   - Navigate to any resource page (e.g., `/resource/{id}`)
   - Open browser console
   - Look for upload logs
   - Verify the image displays
   - Check that the image URL is from your R2 bucket

4. **Verify in database:**
   - Query Weaviate to confirm `imageUrl` field is updated
   - Should contain your R2 public URL

## Benefits

### âœ… Advantages

1. **Reliability**: Images are hosted on your infrastructure, not dependent on external sources
2. **Performance**: Cloudflare's global CDN ensures fast image delivery
3. **Control**: You own and control all images
4. **Cost-effective**: R2 has no egress fees (unlike AWS S3)
5. **Automatic**: Runs transparently when users view resources
6. **Consistency**: All images stored in a standardized format and location

### ðŸ“Š Storage Optimization

- Images organized in `resources/` folder
- Unique filenames prevent collisions
- Timestamp-based naming for versioning
- Automatic content-type detection

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. [ ] Configure Cloudflare R2 bucket and credentials
2. [ ] Update `.env.local` with your R2 credentials
3. [ ] Test with a few resources
4. [ ] Monitor R2 storage usage

### Future Enhancements

1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Resize/compress images before upload
   - Generate multiple sizes (thumbnails, preview, full)
   - Convert to WebP format for better compression

2. **Caching**:
   - Skip upload if image already exists in R2
   - Check by filename or hash

3. **Retry Logic**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for failed uploads
   - Queue failed uploads for retry

4. **Batch Processing**:
   - Create a script to upload images for existing resources
   - Background job to process resources without images

5. **Image Validation**:
   - Verify image dimensions and file size
   - Check for valid image formats
   - Scan for malicious content

6. **Analytics**:
   - Track upload success/failure rates
   - Monitor R2 storage usage
   - Alert on quota limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Missing Cloudflare R2 credentials"
- **Solution**: Ensure all 5 environment variables are set in `.env.local`

**Issue**: Images not uploading
- **Solution**: Check API token permissions, verify bucket name

**Issue**: Images upload but don't display
- **Solution**: Enable public access on your R2 bucket

**Issue**: "Failed to download image"
- **Solution**: Some websites block automated downloads; may need custom headers

**Issue**: TypeScript errors
- **Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure @aws-sdk/client-s3 is installed

## Code Locations for Reference

- R2 utility: `lib/r2-util.ts:33-86`
- Upload endpoint: `app/api/upload-to-r2/route.ts:5-43`
- Resource page logic: `app/resource/[id]/page.tsx:89-135`
- Database update: `lib/weaviate-util.ts:1128-1148`
- PATCH handler: `app/api/resource/[id]/route.ts:29-57`

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables are server-side only (not exposed to client)
- R2 credentials never sent to frontend
- API routes validate input parameters
- Consider rate limiting the upload endpoint
- Monitor for abuse or excessive uploads

## Maintenance

- Regularly rotate Cloudflare API tokens
- Monitor R2 storage costs
- Set up alerts for quota limits
- Periodically review uploaded images
- Consider implementing image lifecycle policies (auto-delete old versions)
